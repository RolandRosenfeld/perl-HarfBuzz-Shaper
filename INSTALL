Introduction
------------

HarfBuzz::Shaper is a Perl module that interfaces with the native
harfbuzz library. It uses the XS facility to bridge between Perl and
native C code.

To build this module, you must therefore have a C-compiler and the
harfbuzz libraries installed.

Linux
-----

On Linux you need to install the following packages:

    harfbuzz

Often the development parts of the harfbuzz library are in a separate
package. So if there is a package named harfbuzz-devel you need to
install that as well.

Microsoft Windows
-----------------

The preferred Perl software for MSWindows is Strawberry Perl. It can
be downloaded from https://strawberryperl.com. It includes C-compiler
and other development tools.

As of version 5.30, this package also contains the harfbuzz library.
So if you install this, or a newer, version of Strawberry Perl you are
all set to go.

If you have an older version of Strawberry Perl you need to add the
harfbuzz library and some other dependent libraries. The easiest way
to do this is

 - download
https://github.com/sciurius/perl-HarfBuzz-Shaper/releases/download/R0.016/harfbuzz-msw64-strawberry.zip
- on the PC, go to the Strawberry Perl folder. Usually, this is
C:\Strawberry.
- unpack the contents of the downloaded zip into this folder
**overwriting existing files**. It will replace a number of files in
the C subfolder.

Now you can build HarfBuzz::Shaper as usual.
