HarfBuzz::Shaper
================

HarfBuzz::Shaper is a perl module that provides access to a small
subset of the native HarfBuzz library.

The subset is suitable for typesetting programs that need to deal with
complex languages like Devanagari.

This module is intended to be used with module L<Text::Layout>. Feel
free to (ab)use it for other purposes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the HarfBuzz library, version 1.6.0 or later, to
be installed on the system.

To build, the HarfBuzz development library and associated include
files are required, in particular include file
/usr/include/harfbuzz/hb.h and libharfbuzz (linked using
-lharfbuzz.

Unfortunately, there is currently no decent method to require external
libraries...
